This means the size of your units *must be optimized* or else you will definitely lose in the long-run, which is  exactly what happens to 95% of gamblers.

    "1. The probability of winning the bet is known $\\frac{1}{2}<p<1$ and the probability of a loss is $q = 1-p$, and each bet is independent of each other. \n",

    "3. In the market we never really get an **even payoff** which is just a line that is $\\pm 100$. Generally we consider a scenario that **b** units are won per unit bet per win and **a** units are lost per unit bet per loss. For example if the market gives UIUC -110, the b = 1 units and a = 1.1 units. The opposite is true if UIUC is -110. \n",

    "**Example:** Let's say UIUC is playing Michigan at home and Vegas (the market) has UIUC -1, yet Jonah's model predicts UIUC's spread to be -7 which would give us an absolute difference of 6 from the market. Historically, Jonah's model gives us a 56% chance of hitting if the difference between his line and the market's absolute difference is 6. Right now the market for UIUC is favored by (-1) and -110. \n",
    "This means you need to **risk** $110 to win $100. Thus, b = 1 (b represents unit that are won per unit bet per win) and a = 1.1 ( a represents units that are lost per unit bet per loss.)\n",

    "- Right now he is 53.12% right on predicting totals and around 52.5% right on predicting spreads, something that would be expected and indicates how the betting market is incredibly efficient. Theoretically speaking, lines that are -110 should never be bet unless Jonah's model accuracy is $>52.380$%. \n",
    "    - Why?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Because in a risk-neutral world your **expected payoff is always 0.** A line that is -110 implies a risk-neutral probability of $52.38$% of happening. However, if you have a model that says **nooo** actually the probability **of that event occuring is 54%** then it would be appropriate to bet on that game with an appropriate allocation. **Never bet more than you should**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Rememeber this number maximizes your wealth **in the long-run** so I recommend that you should never bet greater than percentage based on a probabilitic and mathematical basis, and remember it is always better to be conservative than aggressive, so some people would divide that 6.909% by one-half and bet that amount. \n"
